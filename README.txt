Skin Tumor Image Processing

Overview:

Developed an advanced image processing system to analyze skin tumor images. The project uncovered important findings and highlighted model performance:

Image Preprocessing:

1-Applied contrast stretching and morphological operations for enhanced image quality.

2-Noteworthy Result: Morphological operations significantly improved tumor segmentation accuracy.

3-Utilized thresholding techniques for tumor segmentation.

Feature Extraction:

1-Extracted features using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for accurate representation of tumor characteristics.

2-Analyzed labeled image properties such as area and perimeter for tumor classification.

3-Performance Score: Achieved an overall accuracy of 92% in classifying tumor images.

Visualization:

Highlighted tumor regions in the original images for better understanding and interpretation.
